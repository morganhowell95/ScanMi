ScanMi
======

ScanMi is a developing technology that allows user specific images/logos to contain embedded information through slight pixel modification.  The information is embedded using a raster scan style unique pixel modifier and can be scanned by a camera, once optimized, to be decrypted through a form of cellular automata that corrects offset pixels for error thresholds.
